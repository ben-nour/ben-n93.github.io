For as long as I've worked as a data analyst I've kept a private Github repository which consists solely of a Markdown file with SQL tips and tricks I've learnt, like using `EXCEPT` to find the differences between two data sets or why it's important to avoid ambiguity when naming calculated fields.

A couple of months ago I decided to make the repo [public](https://github.com/ben-nour/SQL-tips-and-tricks) and was quite surprised
when it went viral.

First it made it to the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/):

And then it was featured in an issue of the [Data Elixir newsletter](https://dataelixir.com/) (and became the most clicked article of that issue):

<div style="text-align: center;">
{{< figure src="/images/data_elixir_sql_tips.png" height="600" >}}
</div>

And, of course, the repository stars started coming in:

The folks at [/r/SQL](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1fl1fvz/ive_put_together_a_list_of_some_sql_tips_that_i/) and [/r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1fmmtxf/some_sql_tips_and_tricks_i_shared_with_the_folk/) also found it of interest, adding their own useful suggestions in the comments thread.

I'm pleased so many people found it useful and it was a nice reminder to publish what you know - someone else might just find it handy!
