Hi there!

I'm a data analyst based in Sydney, Australia.

You can view some of my projects [here](https://ben-nour.com/projects/).

On my [blog](https://ben-nour.com/blog/) I write about all things data, like applying colour conditional formatting in Tableau and using the Spotify API with Python to analyse my music listening habits.

You can contact me at [hello@ben-nour.com](mailto:hello@ben-nour.com) and be sure to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/ben-nour).
